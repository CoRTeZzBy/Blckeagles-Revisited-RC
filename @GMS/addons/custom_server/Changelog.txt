v 6.92

1. [Added] simulation management for dead AI when blck_useBlckeaglsSimulationManagement == true;
2. [Deleted] unused files.
3. [Added] A monitor to catch wandering units and send them back to the mission.
4. [Fixed] Some issues with vehicles not being unlocked when AI hop out.
5. [Added] a setting to disable deployment of smoke when AI heal.
	blck_useSmokeWhenHealing = true;  // when true, injured AI will toss a smoke when they attempt to heal.
6. [Added] Support for claim-vehicle scripts is now built-in 
	blck_allowClaimVehicle = true; // To allow players to claim vehicles (Exile only).
7. [Added] an option to display kill notices using Toasts
	blck_aiKillUseToast=true; // in blckClient.sqf in the debug folder of your mission.pbo to enable these.
8. [Added] Support for offloading AI to clients
	////////
	//  Client Offloading and Headless Client Configurations
	blck_useHC = true; // Experimental (death messages and rewards not yet working).
	//  Credit to Defent and eraser for their excellent work on scripts to transfer AI to clients upon which these scripts are based.
	blck_ai_offload_to_client = true; // forces AI to be transfered to player's PCs.  Disable if you have players running slow PCs.
	blck_ai_offload_notifyClient = false;  // Set true if you want notifications when AI are offloaded to a client PC. Only for testing/debugging purposes.
	blck_limit_ai_offload_to_blckeagls = true;  // when true, only groups spawned by blckeagls are evaluated.

9. [Fixed] An issue whereby vehicles would not unlock when AI got out of mission vehicles rather than being killed.
10. [Changed] code for spawning vehicles redone to reduced redundancy.
11. [Fixed] a bug whereby some types of loot containers could not be loaded in Epoch (Thanks to MGTDB for the fix).

V 6.90
1. Added new settings to specify the number of crew per vehhicle to blck_config.sqf and blck_config_mil.sqf
  
    // global settings for this parameters
    // Determine the number of crew plus driver per vehicle; excess crew are ignored.
    // This can be a value or array of [_min, _max];
	blck_vehCrew_blue = 3;
	blck_vehCrew_red = 3;
	blck_vehCrew_green = 3;
	blck_vehCrew_orange = 3;

    You can also define this value in missions by adding the following variable definition to the mission template:

    _vehicleCrewCount = [3,6]; // min/max number of AI to load including driver. see the missions\blue\template.sqf and blck_configs.sqf for more info.

2.  Lists of items to be excluded from dynamically generated loadouts has been moved to:
    blck_config.sqf
    blck_config_mil.sqf

3. Added a new setting that specifies whether logging of blacklisted items is done (handy for debugging)
    blck_logBlacklistedItems = true;  // set to false to disable logging 

4. Hit and Killed event handlers extensively reworked. Methods for notification of nearby AI and Vehicles of the killers whereabouts were revised to be more inclusive of neighboring AI.

5. Issues with AIHit events fixed; AI now deploy smoke and heal.

6. Removed some unnecessary logging.

7. Other minor coding fixes and optimizations.
